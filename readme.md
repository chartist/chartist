This project was built as our final submission for **[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)**. Chartist is a web application that provides a friendly and fast way to share information.

### The stack

* Ruby on Rails
* TDD with RSpec & FactoryGirl
* BDD with Capybara
* HTML5 & CSS3 using Twitter Boostrap
* PostgreSQL
* External libraries: Devise, Omniauth, GroupDate, Chronic, Roo, Spreadsheet
* JavaScript, jQuery & AngularJS
* JSON responses, anyone can fetch data from Charti.st!

### Our process

During the 2 weeks we followed agile methodologies to ship code early and fast. We strongly believe in continuous deployment and fast prototyping.

We begin each day with a short 30-min meeting to assess the day's goals and then split for the rest of the day to work on several issues while keeping some
extra time on the day to fix issues as they arise.
Our final project conveyed a learning opportunity for all of us, so we decided to pair on the most challenging features, like developing the **[Chart Feature](https://github.com/chartist/chartist/blob/master/app/models/chart.rb)**
with a proper test-suite that covered **[integration-testing](https://github.com/chartist/chartist/blob/master/spec/features/chart_feature_spec.rb)**, **[unit-testing](https://github.com/chartist/chartist/blob/master/spec/models/chart_spec.rb)**
and **[requests](https://github.com/chartist/chartist/blob/master/spec/requests/chart_request_spec.rb)**.
